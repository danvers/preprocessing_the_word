These files have been downloaded from a GitHub repo hosting "The C/C++ Users Journal CD-ROM, Release
4." Link to the repo is [here]. Note that this appears to be a re-release of the original Gage
algorithm from 1994. That is available from the top of the repository at SOURCE/1994/FEB94, though
it's also included in the current directory.
