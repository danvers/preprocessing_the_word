This repository hosts a notebook and slides for a presentation I gave at the Source Code Criticism
workshop, hosted by Hannes Bajohr and Markus Krajewski from March 25--26 ([info][]).

Want to see the embedded images or run the notebook? You'll need the data, which you can find
[here][]. Put this in the top level of the directory. Be sure to install all the libraries from 
`requirements.txt`; I've used Python 3.7.3.
